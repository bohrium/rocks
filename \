    \mtit{Rocks from the Ground Up}
         {A Firm Foundation in Geology}
         {Sam Tenka \hspace{1.0 cm} 2020}

    Rocks are hard; their study, harder.  These notes aim to survey rock theory
    not with the onomatapoeic impenetrability, weight, and dryness of museum
    glass, 3rd edition textbooks, and tasting sessions, but in basic terms that
    illustrate the unity of science.  The ideal audience is Emmy Noether and
    Henri Poincar\'e.  A brilliant high schooler might also enjoy these notes.

    %We limit prerequisites to \emph{calculus}, but these notes will reward
    %prior exposure to Ein\emph{stein}'s special relativity and its attendant
    %\emph{geo}metry.

    \mchp{Scylla and Charybdis}

        Science is marked by its emphasis on observation --- above reason,
        aesthetics, intuition, and revelation from authority --- as a means to
        know the world.
        %
        Nevertheless, intuition plays a fundamental, unavoidable role in
        shaping our Bayesian priors.
        %
        Kant, for instance, proposed that our ability to sense gives rise to
        synthetic propositions known prior to experience.  To Kant, one's
        internal understanding of one's vision suggests before one sees any
        particular thing that space is three-dimensional.  One thus expects to
        observe nature as a collection of objects of definite color, smell, and
        texture, located in a three-dimensional space and evolving though
        one-dimensional time.
        %
        Shockingly, the 20th century forced a retreat from those scene-setting
        intuitions.  Subtle experiments and right reasoning revealed these
        coordinates of description to be far from independent.

        %(\textbf{A}) the relations between space and time are not as we expect.
        %Thus, a 70 mph cheetah chasing a 60 mph antelope may perceive its prey
        %as drawing nearer by \emph{more} than 10 mph.
